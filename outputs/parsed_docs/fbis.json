The 22-23 January edition of the Skopje newspaper VECER in Macedonian published on pages 6-7 the results of an opinion poll conducted by the \"BriMa\" agency in November 1993. According to VECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but the paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of error. For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results of an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval\/disapproval ratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: November 1993 May 1993 Kiro Gligorov, President of the Republic 76\/15 78\/13 Vasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian 50\/36 43\/37 official in Federal Yugoslavia Ljubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister 50\/42 42\/43 Stojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman 48\/41 48\/39 Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister 46\/41 44\/38 Vlado Popovski, Defense Minister 41\/41 36\/37 Stevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister 40\/43 No Data Given Petar Gosev, Democratic Party leader 34\/53 40\/42 Todor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian 32\/53 No Data Given Nikola Popovski, Social Democratic 29\/46 32\/42 Party parliamentarian VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating of 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 percent among respondents between 18 and 24. Residents of Skopje ranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the ranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, Andov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola Popovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency for Public Opinion Research and published \"exclusively\" by the Skopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead in popularity among political figures. According to the 31 December 1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by means of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of Macedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from surveys made in March, June, and September for comparison. Some of the following percentages are approximate values that were derived from the graph published by the paper: March June September December Kiro Gligorov 87 82.33 89.33 89 Stevo Crvenkovski 54 65 49 63 Stojan Andov 61 62 60 61 Branko Crvenkovski 56 60 54 53.5 Ljubomir Frckovski 35 45 48 50 Petar Gosev 50 31 52 49.53 Jovan Andonov, Deputy Prime Minister 39 39 50 37 Vlado Popovski 18 25 36 35 Kiro Popovski, Deputy Chairman, Parliament 26 27 33 32 Ante Popovski, leader of MAAK (Movement for All- Macedonian Action) 29 32 32 indistinct Jane Miljovski, Minister without Portfolio -- 23 31 24 Vladimir Golubovski VMRO-DP (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party) leader -- 30 25 23 Nevzat Halili Party for Democratic Prosperity official 38.33 38 18 18 Lj upco Georgievski VMRO-DPMNE (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity) official 18 10 16 17 Dosta Dimovska VMRO-DPMNE official -- 11 17 16 On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published the results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences. \"BriMa,\" working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036 people. Question: \"If elections were held today, for which party would you vote?\" (all numbers are percentages) SDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia) 22.8 VMRO-DPMNE 11.2 Democratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev) 6.3 Socialist Party 3.3 Liberal Party (LP) 3.2 Workers Party 2.9 PCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies in Macedonia) 1.8 Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia 0.8 MAAK 0.3 Another party 4.0 Undecided 18.6 Would not vote 6.6 VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than their overall scores indicate. For example, the DP was about twice as popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the capital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7 percent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the Bregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially higher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall. Question: \"Do you have confidence in the following parties?\" (all numbers are percentages) Yes No Do Not Know SDSM 28 51 21 VMRO-DPMNE 15 72 14 LP 19 59 22 PDP-NDP* 20 73 7 *Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little confidence in any of the parties currently active in the country. Respondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country to have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20 percent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were correlated with party preferences, producing the following results: Of those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections soon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80 percent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79 percent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80 percent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14 percent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very important which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it was somewhat significant.

S.-IAEA","h3":"Pyongyang Signals Preference for Talks With U.S. Over ROK","text":"SUMMARY Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for resumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by the North Korean regime to score polemical points against the South and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington over Seoul on the nuclear issue. END SUMMARY Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang countered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact with a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at gaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul. According to Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief delegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone message to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 March. Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for two days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached with Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks. The 25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 February, specified 1 March as the date the following will take place \"simultaneously\": + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's running of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent to Seoul's decision. + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear inspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss exchanging of special presidential envoys. + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level bilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South contacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about appearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear inspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but Washington on the nuclear issue. In the latest attempt to portray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper Nodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President Kim Yong-sam for allegedly acting \"as if he receives U.S. reports on DPRK-U.S. talks\" and \"as if he controls the talks\" (Pyongyang radio, 28 February). Kim creates this impression, the commentary added, even though \"he is not even qualified to join the talks.\" Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance was also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North Korea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press conference commemorating the first year of his presidency. Departing from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal attacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean dialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped abuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a \"traitor,\" a \"puppet,\" and a \"political mountebank,\" accusing him of \"arch crimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression,\" and promoting national \"division and confrontation,\" and of plain \"stupidity.\" KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the probable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal for an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that his \"criminal\" policy \"against the North\" had been wrong. The party paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed Kim's \"preposterously absurd remarks\" (Pyongyang radio). DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet with Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming talks with Washington. Although monitored Pyongyang media have not commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral talks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission to the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as being optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations. In an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28 February), Ho termed it \"fortunate\" that Washington, \"although belatedly,\" withdrew \"unjustified preconditions\" to resumption of the high-level talks, thus paving way for \"a package solution\" of \"not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing in the way of diplomatic normalization. Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of Washington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership continues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear negotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the minimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high- level talks with Washington.

{"header":"Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-029--ALGERIA","h3":"ALGERIA: PRESS ABSTRACTS NO. 4","text":"The following summaries highlight information from articles that appeared in the Algiers French- and regional Arabic-language press in January and February. Liamine Zeroual's Image Favorable A report in the Arabic-language Doha (Qatar) daily AL-SHARQ of 3 February states that the public views newly elected President Liamine Zeroual as a very shrewd and experienced military man who can return Algeria \"to the days of Boumedienne.\" According to the report, Zeroual is seen as the man who can end the confrontation between the Islamists and the nationalists since he effectively pushed for dialogue and reconciliation when he was defense minister. Zeroual reportedly considers nationalism inseparable from Islam as part of his new national order: \"Zeroual goes back to the origins of the Algerian revolution when nationalism embraced Islam during the battle for independence. In the sixties the two diverged. Nationalism embraced socialism and Islam was marginalized. When socialism failed, Islam came back forcefully.\" Zeroual has reportedly created a positive image through his efforts as defense minister to deal in a positive manner with both the (Islamic Salvation Front) FIS and the regime. As a result, FIS leader Rabah Kebir says his party anticipates that Zeroual will change policy, but not necessarily replace government officials. According to the report, Kebir's statement indicates that the FIS is becoming more flexible and wants to undertake serious dialogue with authorities, particularly in light of the communications that took place before and after the National Dialogue in January. Influx of Refugees in the South Provokes Concern French-language Algiers daily EL WATAN of 10 and 23 January has reported that Algerian Tuareg frustration and anger is growing in Tamanrasset because of the high number of illegal foreigners (mainly from Niger, Mali, and Ghana) who reportedly outnumber Algerians in the region. The Tuaregs hold these foreigners responsible for increasing crime rates, attacks against tourists, and drug trafficking which weakens the economy and creates a security problem in the region. Hadj Moussa Akhmokh, a prominent Tuareg authority, says a 1992 plan to improve regional security was unsuccessful and that \"the situation has become worse.\" In December, for example, the two national firms National Company for Mining Research (SONAREM) and Center for Energy Research (CREM) were looted and several vehicles were stolen. In addition, customs officials from Tamanrasset were kidnapped by a group of individuals armed with Kalashnikovs, robbed, and taken to Niger where they were manhandled before being released. According to Hadj Akhamokh, the more recent kidnapping of 18 Tuaregs (10 Algerians and eight Malians) set a \"serious\" precedent and was the \"last straw.\" Citizens planned a peaceful march to demonstrate their anger and to attract the attention of authorities until Hadj Akhamokh convinced them to postpone the march. Hadj Akhmokh stated the Tuaregs have responded to his appeal, but that they are \"impatient,\" and are waiting for the government to take control of the situation. According to Hadj Akhamokh, smuggling is also a serious problem. He faults local police for participating in the corruption and allowing it to continue. Food shipments intended for the local population are being purchased and resold for twice the price across the border, including milk which has been unavailable in the markets for \"months.\" According to Hadj Akhmokh, \"smuggling has grown to proportions that the Tuaregs can no longer tolerate. To starve the people is to push us to revolt.\" (See FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE FB PN 93-151 \"Regional Census Prompted by Security, Economic Concerns,\" 8 April 1993, and NEAR EAST SOUTH ASIA REPORT 93AFO622B \"Illegal Immigrants in South; Census Unreported,\" 12 May 1993 p 11 for additional reporting on this subject.) 'Terrorists' Exert Pressure; Press, Lifestyle Threatened EL WATAN of 16 January reported that \"terrorist threats\" have promoted a climate of fear in the town of Meftah, \"imposing a life style that has nothing to do with Algerian society.\" According to the report, Meftah and Medea have become towns which immerse themselves more and more in Islamic, even \"fundamentalist,\" tendencies. For example, the article stated that tracts posted throughout Meftah threaten that women who do not wear the hijab and who wear Western style clothes will \"have to deal with us.\" In addition threats have been made against beauty salons, Moorish baths, and cassette vendors. \"Fundamentalists\" have also attacked the press, declaring it \"unsuitable reading.\" EL WATAN reported in three articles from 16 to 18 January that newspaper vendors and bookstores in Blida, Medea, ChIef, and El Khemis were no longer selling newspapers. According to EL WATAN of 16 January, national publications, particularly those of the independent press, have suddenly disappeared from the shelves due to \"terrorist threats.\" One citizen reported, \"Don't use my name, but I am afraid to tell you that tobacco shops and bookstores are scared to death. They are convinced that if they continue to sell newspapers there could be serious reprisals.\" EL WATAN of 17 and 18 January reported that vendors have denied the threats, blaming distributors for failing to deliver the newspapers. Nonetheless, security services have ordered merchants to sell newspapers or be shut down. Citizens Reportedly Buying Visas An article in the French-language daily ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 19 January recounted the frustrations of dozens of Algerians trying to obtain French visas. Given the evening curfew, many spend the night in nearby hotels or in the elevators or hallways of neighboring buildings. According to the report, lines can begin as early as 4 a.m., causing citizens to resort to purchasing a place in line for 500-1000 dirhams, depending on the position in line and the time it is purchased. In the words of one citizen, \"It is a real stock exchange.\" The French consulate reportedly closed for two days and suspended issuing visas in an effort to set up a new system whereby visa requests would be handled through the mail.

Joined by Russian media commentators, they have criticized the involvement of high-level U.S. officials in publicizing the case, saying that the case involves normal espionage activity that all countries pursue. In addition, Russian media across the political spectrum have viewed U.S. handling of the incident as evidence of a U.S. desire to marginalize Russia's international role. END SUMMARY In their initial public statements on the Ames case, Russian officials have consistently tried to minimize the incident's impact on U.S.-Russian relations. They have decried the publicity given to the case by high-level U.S. officials, saying that incidents such as the Ames case should be handled by intelligence agencies without involving officials at higher levels: -- According to ITAR-TASS on 24 February, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence services handle the case and \"not to politicize or ideologize the situation.\" He emphasized that it is important for the United States and Russia to continue to \"cooperate and not to attach undue, hypertrophied significance to this case.\" After the Russians expelled a U.S. Embassy officer in retaliation for the U.S. expulsion of a Russian Embassy official in Washington, Kozyrev reiterated these views and claimed Moscow \"had to resort\" to a reciprocal expulsion but this process of \"reciprocity\" should be eliminated, \"the sooner the better\" (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). -- A 25 February Foreign Ministry press statement sniped at U.S. handling of the case, criticizing \"attempts by the special services to drag the political leadership into their mutual relations,\" and noted that there are \"appropriate channels\" that can be \"brought fully\" into use to deal with such cases. The statement said that if, as reported, the investigation of Ames had begun ten months ago, \"this was sufficient time for us to be contacted directly\" and for U.S. officials to \"share their anxieties with us before making them public\" (ITAR-TASS, 25 February). -- Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) officials refused to comment directly on Ames, but expressed surprise that the United States made such an outcry over actions FIS officials described as common practice for all intelligence services. FIS director Yevgeniy Primakov had \"no comment\" on the case (ITAR- TASS, 23 February). FIS press spokesman Yuriy Kobaladze noted that declining to comment on such allegations is the general practice among intelligence services and stressed \"there is nothing new or sensational here in the fact that countries engage in intelligence activities\" (Moscow radio, Russian TV, 23 February). He went on to claim that neither the United States nor Russia had \"ever pledged to curtail intelligence activity\" and that Washington has \"been very active\" in intelligence activity in Russia and the other newly independent states. Breaking ranks, at least temporarily, with other officials, Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, acknowledged Ames' links to Russia but later retracted this admission. A 26 February ITAR-TASS report quoted Kolesnikov as saying \"Ames worked in the UnitedStates for Russia\" but nonetheless claiming that he had \"inflicted no direct damage\" on the United States. On 28 February, however, Kolesnikov stated that the General Staff and its intelligence service \"have no information on any links\" between Ames and Soviet or Russian intelligence agencies. According to ITAR-TASS, Kolesnikov went on to claim that \"U.S. media misinterpreted\" his 26 February statement (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). Russian Media Russian media across the political spectrum indignantly criticized U.S. handling of the case and speculated, sometimes on the basis of comments by unnamed officials, that the United States had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of Ames. Some commentators said that U.S. officials had exposed the case now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate U.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of reform in Russia, while others alleged that the United States wanted to take the gloss off Russia's diplomatic success in brokering a compromise over Sarajevo. Media commentary, even in publications like Izvestiya, a strong supporter of Russian efforts to integrate with the West, supported the Russian government position and criticized the United States: -- A 24 February article in Izvestiya remarked on what it saw as the \"hypocrisy\" of U.S. reaction to the Ames case, since, it claimed, Russia \"has no less right to secret operations in the United States than America has to espionage in Russia.\" A 25 February article on the case headlined the question \"Why Is Washington Making a Fuss?\" and cited \"competent sources\" as speculating that the Ames' arrest was an attempt to put Moscow in its \"place\" after Russian diplomacy in Bosnia for the first time in recent years \"cast the United States in a secondary role.\" -- A 25 February article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta worried that the Ames case is being given \"political overtones\" reminiscent of the 1960 U-2 incident, which triggered a sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations. The article claimed that \"certain forces\" in the United States were trying to \"exaggerate this affair\" because they are unhappy with the new Chernomyrdin government and with Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, which had \"thwarted the hawks' attempt to resolve the Serbian question through air strikes\" and had \"suddenly and very sharply\" increased Russia's \"political weight in the international arena.\" The article concluded, however, that both the U.S. and Russian presidents were demonstrating a \"well-balanced approach\" and expressed hope that political relations between the two countries would not be aggravated. -- A 25 February article in the Defense Ministry's newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed \"experts\" to explain the U.S. \"ballyhoo\" over the case. The article claimed U.S. intelligence agencies wished to get even after the exposure of more than 2O foreign intelligence agents, including U.S. spies, in the last year. An article on 26 February charged that the \"fuss\" over the \"routine event\" of a double agent's exposure is taking on an \"increasingly hysterical character\" in the United States, claiming with obvious sarcasm that \"Langley believes that only [its agents] have the right to carry out intelligence activity.\" Prominent Krasnaya Zvezda observer Aleksandr Golts, in a commentary published on 1 March, implicitly took issue with this analysis, however, claiming instead that it is Russia's newly demonstrated foreign policy independence that has \"driven Washington berserk.\" Golts contended that the United States is publicizing the Ames case because Russia's efforts to \"implement an active foreign policy course\" with its \"successful initiative in the Balkans\" had put the United States \"on the sidelines\" after it had become accustomed to \"feeling that it is the only world leader, the only superpower.\" He concluded by advocating the \"vital necessity\" of a \"partnership\" with the \"rules of conduct. .. the same for everyone. -- The independent pro-reform newspaper Segodnya, in a 24 February article, warned that the Ames case would revive the \"old outcry\" that the \"Russians cannot be trusted.\" The article linked the case to Yeltsin's Bosnia initiative, particularly his proposal for a summit on the issue. Claiming that Yeltsin's summit proposal would be \"inconvenient\" for Western leaders, the article implied that the Ames \"scandal\" had been whipped up to \"remove the Russian initiative from the agenda.\" A 1 March article cited unnamed sources as saying that Russian security services \"are not interested in arousing passions,\" but that \"influential U.S. forces\" are hoping to \"impose a time-out\" for the United States to reexamine its policy toward Russia. -- In an interview published in the 26 February edition of the labor-oriented newspaper Trud, retired KGB Major General Boris Solomatin, citing examples of other spy cases where there was no official outcry, bitterly ascribed what he called Washington's \"inappropriate reaction\" to the Ames affair to U.S. \"imperial thinking\" about Russia. Lamenting that Russia had been \"transformed\" from an equal power whose intelligence services could work against those of the United States to one which now \"has to ask permission to do so,\" Solomatin complained that the U.S. attitude is \"we can, you cannot\" because \"we have the money\" and \"you have an outstretched hand.\" Contending that the United States had not given much thought to the possible consequences when it \"embarked on this scandal,\" Solomatin claimed that now, when Russians see that the \"big bucks\" spent on intelligence are \"working,\" they will recognize the importance of intelligence and begin to \"organize it properly.\" Implications The pains taken by Russian officials to play down the Ames affair and to minimize its effect on U.S.-Russian relations clearly indicate Moscow's desire to keep the relationship on a firm footing. However, the indignant reaction on the part of both officials and the media to the U.S. handling of the case, as well as the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to relegate Russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence activities, indicates that Moscow will continue to assert itself when it feels that the United States is trying to take unfair advantage.

Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-O2MAR94-RUSSIA","h3":"Yeltsin Restructures Media Bureaucracy","text":"SUMMARY Using his decree power to reorganize the media bureaucracy, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has consolidated his control over the broadcast media and attenuated the influence of the other branches of government and the cabinet. At the same time he has taken the first step in what is likely to be a far reaching, if reversible, reduction of the state's role in television by giving a private television company access to Russia's 4th television channel. The reorganization appears to signal that longtime close Yeltsin adviser Mikhail Poltoranin, who once shaped Yeltsin's media policy, no longer enjoys the President's confidence in this area. END SUMMARY In a series of edicts dating from 5 December, Yeltsin has effected a complete restructuring of state media structures and shuffled key media personnel consolidating his authority over state television, expanding private access to television broadcasting, and creating a potentially powerful new media arbitration court (see box 1). Begin Box 1 Yeltsin Decrees Changes in Media Structures In a series of edicts issued from 5 December to 4 January, Russian President Boris Yeltsin reorganized state television, created a new media oversight body, and made major changes in key media posts: --A 5 December edict \"On the Directors of VGTRK [the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company--RTV]\" reappointed Oleg Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko as chairman and general director respectively of RTV (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December 1993). --A 22 December edict \"On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere\" abolished the Ministry of the Press and Information and the Federal Information Center (FIC), created the Russian Federation Committee for the Press and the Federal Service of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and appointed Boris Mironov to head the former and Aleksandr Yakovlev the latter (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). --A second 22 December edict \"On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company\" consolidated state control over the the national television broadcast infrastructure (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). --A third 22 December edict \"On Utilizing Moscow Television's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network\" granted an independent television production company, NTV, access to Russia's 4th channel (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). --A 29 December edict \"On the Court of Appeals for Information Disputes Under the President of the Russian Federation\" which is linked explicitly to articles 29 and 80 of the new constitution granting citizens the right to \"freedom of mass information\" and making the president the guarantor of that freedom created a new arbitration body under the president to resolve disputes over television coverage and access (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January). --A 4 January edict officially relieved Mikhail Poltoranin of his duties as head of the FIC (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). End Box 1 President's Role Strengthened Several aspects of the reorganization strengthen the president's powers over the broadcast media. The new television and radio service under Yakovlev will be subordinate to the president, while the edict appointing Poptsov to head RTV extends Yeltsin's appointment powers to an area once held by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. The creation of 'Efir' consolidates state control over the television broadcast infrastructure under a presidential appointee, and the new information appeals court gives the president a potentially great advantage over the other branches of government in determining the political slant and content of television programming. Profile Lowered By giving the new press committee and broadcast service sub- cabinet rank and moving out Mikhail Poltoranin and Vladimir Shumeyko, two favorite targets of his opponents, Yeltsin appears to be attempting to move the media and media policy away from the front lines of the political struggle. Poltoranin, as chief of the now defunct Federal Information Center (FIC), and Shumeyko, as head of the now abolished Ministry of the Press and Information both held ministerial rank but neither of the heads of the new bodies has ministerial rank or cabinet status. New Bodies' Powers The reorganization gives the new broadcasting service the preeminent role in regulating broadcast media, eliminating overlapping responsibilities that existed under the former structures. From the FIC the broadcast service inherits the functions of \"coordinating\" state policy for television and radio, assisting in the provision of \"objective\" information to domestic and international audiences on Russian political and economic issues, and participating in the process of drafting legislation on the broadcast media. From the Press and Information Ministry the service inherits responsibilities for implementing state television and radio broadcasting policy and for television and radio licensing and registration. The service also has authority to administer government financing and subsidies for national and regional television (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993) but its authority has been severely circumscribed by the Ministry of Finance (see box 2). The 22 December edict names the Committee on the Press the legal successor to both the Ministry of Press and Information and the FIC but does not elaborate its functions in detail. It presumably will assume the FIC and press ministry functions that relate specifically to the press. The edict does explicitly establish that the committee will administer government financing and subsidies, formerly a prerogative of the press ministry. Begin Box 2 Finance Ministry Cuts Television Budget On 1 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin had recently \"notified representatives of Ostankino and Russian Television . . . of a 50 percent cut in financing.\" The decision, if not amended, could have a devastating impact on both the television companies and the Ministry of Communications which broadcasts the television signals and depends heavily on state television for its own revenues. Russian Television General Director Anatoliy Lysenko predicted that the funding cuts could force transmitter shutdowns and lead to the \"loss of the broadcasting network on a large territory of Russia\" (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 29 January). It is not clear if the ministry's decision to slash funding is a first step in a policy of reducing state ownership, as Yakovlev and others have advocated, or if state television simply served as a convenient target of opportunity in the finance ministry's struggle to control the money supply. End Box 2 Poltoranin Routed Aspects of the reorganization strongly suggest that Poltoranin, once the most influential figure in the Yeltsin administration in shaping media policy has suffered a startling defeat at the hands of his rival for influence Shumeyko. According to Yuriy Baturin, Yeltsin's security adviser and a co-drafter of the existing law on the mass media, Yeltsin, Shumeyko, and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin jointly agreed to the terms of the 22 December edict \"On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere\" (Izvestiya, 29 December 1993). That edict provided for separate commissions to liquidate the Press Ministry and the FIC but appointed Shumeyko to head both. Poltoranin also appears to have lost a battle over the edict granting NTV access to channel 4, a move which he reportedly opposed. Despite his removal as FIC head, Poltoranin will continue to be involved in media policy- -possibly even in opposition to Yeltsin--as head of the Committee on Information Policy and Communications in the State Duma (ITAR- TASS; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 19 January). But, for the first time since before Yeltsin was elected president, (See Note 1) Poltoranin will not have the authority to directly influence the administration's media policy or to advise the president in an official capacity. (Note 1) With the exception of a brief hiatus from 25 November 1992 when he stepped down as Minister of the Press and Information to 25 December 1992 when he was appointed head of the newly created Federal Information Center. Poltoranin was appointed Minister of the Press and Information 10 July 1990 by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. Yakovlev's Vision for Television Yeltsin's appointment of \"the father of glasnost\" and former close Gorbachev adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev to head the new broadcasting service sends ambiguous signals about his intentions regarding the broadcast media. Yakovlev once served as the head of the CPSU Central Committee's propaganda department and yet has been credited as the architect of the glasnost strategy to liberalize the Soviet media. Although he has a reputation as a reformer he does not appear to advocate westernization of Russia or unrestricted freedom for the media. In an Izvestiya interview (24 December) following his appointment, Yakovlev stated that he would refrain from \"influencing\" subject matter but rather play a \"strategic\" role as Ostankino chairman. At the same time, however, he expressed hope that the company will be able to fulfill its role in society \"without succumbing to extremes\" and on another occasion he spoke of increasing \"the share of Russian programs\" as a \"counterweight\" to foreign productions, and criticized excessive sex and violence--generally attributed to foreign influence--on television (RRIA, 2 February). He has also apparently agreed recently to introduce a new weekly program on Ostankino in which Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey Filatov will \"explain\" presidential edicts (Mayak Radio, 31 January). Yakovlev's appointment may signal future reductions in the state's role in television. He has asserted that there \"must be one state television company\" which would operate without paid advertising instead of the four companies (See Note 2) that exist now (RIA, 2 February). This goal appears to go hand-in-hand with the recent decision of the finance ministry to cut funding (see box 2) and may indeed become the ultimate solution to the state's difficulty financing state television at current levels. Realization of Yakovlev's goal of having one non-commercial state television company could also provide a financial shot in the arm to non-state television since it would become the only vehicle for television advertising. (Note 2) The four are Ostankino, RTV, Channel 4, and the St. Petersburg Channel. Yakovlev's Deputy Valentin Lazutkin, a longtime television professional who appears to share Yakovlev's views on reducing the state's role in television has been appointed as Yakovlev's deputy. With Yakovlev taking a \"strategic\" approach to his chairmanship, Lazutkin, who has spent nearly 30 years in television, and served as first deputy chairman at Ostankino until his recent promotion will presumably run day-to-day operations at Ostankino. Asked in a recent interview published in Izvestiya, (21 January) about his opinion on the recent change in leadership, he expressed the \"hope\" that \"we need not fear that Ostankino's airspace will be turned into the political property of a particular party, which happened under the former chairman.\" He also noted that he was \"untroubled\" by the recent decision to grant the private production company NTV access to the fourth channel (discussed below), though he did criticize the fact that access to the channel was not granted on a \"competitive\" basis. And finally, discussing his concept of the future of state-run television, Lazutkin said there \"should be one powerful Russian company which is . . . part of the state structure\" and he advocated transforming Ostankino into a company aimed at foreign audiences (including Russian-speaking viewers in the CIS). NTV Gains Broadcast Access In what may be the first step towards realizing Yakovlev's vision of decreasing the number of state television companies, Yeltsin granted television broadcasting rights on channel 4 to an independent company, NTV. The 22 December edict \"On Using Moscow Television's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network\" states that NTV will receive 58 hours of weekly broadcast time as an \"experiment\" aimed at \"developing non-state television.\" NTV has been broadcasting a nightly news program, Segodnya, and a weekly newsmagazine, RItogi, to viewers of the St. Petersburg channel, which has a potential audience of about 70 million viewers, and will continue to do so. The significance of the edict for NTV does not appear to be that it increases potential audience size since the two channels have significant audience overlap but that it secures a measure of independence from St. Petersburg Television. Most importantly the NTV edict affirms Yeltsin's support for the idea of independent television following an apparent tug-of-war within the administration. Yeltsin first issued the edict on 22 November but suspended it the next day (ITAR-TASS, 22 November 1993; 23 November 1993). On 22 December Yeltsin reissued the edict in almost identical form except that the new version tasked the government with reviewing the issue of \"state participation\" in the ranks of the founders, making this text even more privatization-oriented than the original. Control of TV Infrastructure In the reorganization, Yeltsin reaffirmed that the state will retain its monopoly of the broadcast infrastructure, at least for the present. The edict of 22 December \"On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company\" created the Efir holding company, whose assets include much of the state's broadcasting infrastructure. Efir will be partially privatized, with employees receiving some shares, but the edict stipulates that the state will retain ownership of a controlling interest for three years. The edict does not specify, however, what the state will do with its controlling interest after three years. The edict appointed Lazutkin to serve as chairman of Efir's board of directors. Baturin criticized the creation of Efir (and the reorganization in general) which he claims \"increases the state's control over the mass media\" and even \"to a certain extent threatens freedom of the press\" (RIzvestiya, 29 December 1993). Noting that \"all central television channels are broadcast\" through Efir, Baturin asserted that independent television companies will \"remain non- state only in formal terms.\" Control over RTV The reorganization also serves notice that the other major national television company, RTV, will remain under Yeltsin's and Yakovlev's control. Control of the company had been a prolonged point of contention between the President and the former Supreme Soviet. In a demonstration of his authority over RTV, Yeltsin re-appointed the current chairman and general director, Oleg Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko, by the edict of 5 December. Formerly, according to Russian Television's Statute, the right of appointment to these posts was held by the Supreme Soviet Presidium (Sobrianiye Aktov Pravitelsta RSFSR, No 6, 1991). Poltoranin Admirer To Head Press Body The 22 December edict reorganizing the media structures appointed Boris Mironov, former head of the Rossiya Publishing House and apparent close friend and admirer of Poltoranin as chairman of the new Committee on the Press. According to a profile of Mironov from Obshchaya Gazeta, Mironov had previously worked for Komsomolskaya Pravda and with Poltoranin when the latter served at Pravda. Mironov reportedly also served for \"several days\" as chief editor of Rossiyskaya Gazeta but was removed prior to or shortly after publication of the paper's inaugural issue in November 1990 (Obshchaya Gazeta, 14-20 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 6 November 1993). According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta's current chief editor, Natalya Polezhayeva, Mironov was removed \"on the personal orders\" of then Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov. New Media Watchdog Created Yeltsin's establishment of the Court of Appeals for Information Disputes under the president appears to be an attempt to preempt the new parliament from \"interfering\" in media policy as did its predecessor (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January). The court is a successor to the Information Arbitration Court that was created during the recent parliamentary election campaign to ensure fair media coverage with largely the same membership, including chairman Anatoliy Vengerov. During the campaign, Vengerov and the court demonstrated a degree of independence from Yeltsin by ruling that campaigning against the draft constitution was permissible, explicitly opposing Yeltsin's stated position that sought to prohibit such campaigning (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993; Izvestiya, 27 November 1993). The court's powers include the authority to resolve disputes over the distribution of airtime among parliamentary factions. It is also charged with ensuring \"objectivity and authenticity\" in news reporting and the \"principle of pluralism\" in radio and television programming, and may issue warnings regarding potential violations of the media law, a power it inherited from the defunct Ministry of the Press and Information. Despite the court's record of independent action, the edict makes it dependent on the president stipulating that it \"is not part of the system\" of Russian Federation federal courts, and the new body's statute gives the president the power to appoint and fire its members (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February). Prospects Yeltsin has crafted a reorganization of Russian media structures that seems simultaneously to open the door to relinquishing direct control over increasing amounts of broadcast airtime while maintaining presidential control over the main facilities of state television and the process of media oversight. The new parliament may challenge Yeltsin for control of at least some media--there is already talk among deputies of reasserting control over Rossiyskaya Gazeta which the dissolved Supreme Soviet controlled (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 5 January). Yeltsin is likely to strongly resist such attempts and may invoke his enhanced constitutional authority to do so. He may also calculate that more western-style media independence is the best way of ensuring that the media keeps supporting reform and stays out of his opponents' grasp. At the same time economic reality as manifest by the recent one-day widespread broadcast blackout and the Finance Ministry's decision to cut television funding by 50 percent will likely encourage him to move towards granting more and more air time to independent television companies as he has done with NTV and channel 4.

Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-02MAR94-SYRIA","h3":"Syria Scores PLO, Israel, Raises Questions on Talks","text":"SUMMARY Syrian media reacted to the massacre in Hebron by intensifying criticism of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP) and the PLO itself and reviving more hostile anti-Israel rhetoric reminiscent of the years preceding the current peace negotiations. At the same time, despite the Arab suspension of bilateral peace talks with Israel and the use of Syrian media to question the benefits of resuming them without further Israeli concessions, Damascus has taken pains to signal its commitment to the overall peace process. END SUMMARY Syria's closely controlled media have portrayed the 25 February massacre as a direct product of the DOP, implying that the event serves to vindicate Syria's opposition to the agreement. In this context, the media have stepped up criticism of the PLO leadership for signing both the DOP and a subsequent document on its implementation, which was concluded in Cairo on 9 February. A Damascus radio commentary declared that the \"massacre must be directly or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo agreements and whatever other pact may follow.\" It criticized \"Palestinian negotiators\" for having \"forgotten Israel's crime- ridden track record\" and being \"too trustful and unsuspecting, thereby facilitating\" the killings in Hebron (26 February). As reported by Damascus radio the following day, an editorial in the daily Al-Ba'th called the massacre \"the end result\" of \"the flawed and lame agreement\" concluded between Israel and \"the Palestinian negotiators.\" Moreover, in a revival of the volume and virulence of media criticism of the PLO that followed the signing of the DOP in September, Syrian media have given substantial coverage in the wake of the massacre to anti-PLO statements by hardline Damascus- based Palestinian groups. For example: --The official news agency SANA quoted Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command leader Ahmad Jibril as implicitly threatening the lives of 'Arafat and other mainstream PLO leaders (See Note 1). Calling the massacre a \"fruit of the Gaza-Jericho agreement,\" Jibril declared that \"the determination of our Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Islamic nation will punish those who conceded our sanctities, territories, and history\" (27 February). (Note 1) Jibril's threatening statement echoed his declaration on 30 September that \"'Arafat's fate will be no better than that of French General Petain during World War II\" (Damascus radio). --Damascus radio, reporting on a \"mammoth popular demonstration\" in the Palestinian camp al-Yarmuk organized by the hardline factions, quoted Islamic Jihad Movement Secretary General Fathi al-Shaqaqi as calling the massacre \"a continuation of the liquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord\" (28 February). Anti-Israel Vitriol Syrian media have also reverted to the kind of virulent anti- Israel rhetoric that was a staple of Syrian commentary in the past but had been used with less regularity at least since the start of the current peace process in October 1991. Thus, commentaries in the wake of the massacre have very frequently favored the term \"Zionists\" and \"Tel Aviv rulers\" over \"Israel\" and \"the Israeli government.\" Claiming that the Hebron bloodbath was simply the most recent of a long series of Israeli massacres- -alleged to have included the 27 February church bombing in Lebanon (for example, Damascus radio, 27 February)--the commentaries have declared bluntly that the killings are consistent with the nature of Zionism and demonstrate the impossibility of Arab-Israeli \"coexistence.\" Several commentaries in the daily Tishrin, as reported in same-day broadcasts by Damascus radio, followed in this vein: --On 26 February an editorial claimed that the Hebron massacre \"proves the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and Israelis resulting from the fascist Zionist rancor against the Arabs.\" --An editorial the following day declared that, through the recent massacre, \"Zionism is addressing a message that it has not changed . . . its racist and aggressive colors.\" --An editorial on the 28th claimed that \"Zionism and racism . thrive on rivers of blood\" and referred to Israel as \"this racist Nazi Zionist ghoul.\" Commitment to Peace Process, But ... Nevertheless, Damascus has taken pains to emphasize commitment to the peace process, while using the media to question the utility of resuming the now-suspended talks in the absence of significant concessions by Israel--a tack it has taken during previous disruptions in the negotiations. The Damascus radio announcement of the suspension of bilateral peace talks in Washington by Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan was quick to cite a Syrian spokesman as having \"confirmed statements by U.S. officials that this step does not mean an end to the whole peace process that began two years ago\" (28 February). Two subsequent media commentaries that referred to the suspension of talks also took pains to convey that the suspension is temporary and to stress that Syria remains committed to the peace process. Damascus radio, affirming that \"the Arabs are advocates of true peace,\" declared that \"the suspension of talks will not harm the peace talks, especially since only a few days are left before the conclusion\" of the current session (1 March). And the daily Al-Ba'th on the same day followed up mention of the suspension of talks by adding that the Arabs are not \"terminating the peace efforts\" but are \"in effect telling the sponsors of the peace process to wake up to their responsibilities\" (Damascus radio). At the same time, some editorial commentary has cast doubt on the usefulness of negotiations under current conditions and called on Washington to play a more vigorous role in pressing Israel for concessions (See Note 2). For example, Damascus radio declared that \"talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist escalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of time,\" adding that \"it is, indeed, absurd.\" The commentary concluded that \"there is no purpose or meaning in holding any peace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment to implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from the occupied Arab territories\" (28 February). As reported by the radio, a subsequent editorial in Al-Thawrah asserted that \"salvaging the peace process and the stalled peace talks requires the application of all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it honor the relevant international legitimacy resolutions and conventions, respect human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm settlers, and return to the Arabs all their territories and rights\" (2 March). (Note 2) Such expressions of doubt, and even the conditioning of resuming the talks on Israeli concessions, have appeared periodically in Syrian media commentary since the beginning of the peace process. For example, an editorial in Tishrin last November declared that \"any resumption of the peace talks\"--which had not then convened since before the signing of the DOP--must be preceded by a clear and public Israeli commitment to the peace process and its principles, especially full withdrawal from the Arab territories\" (Damascus radio, 20 November 1993). Several weeks later, however, Damascus announced its intention to return to the peace talks, without any public commitment from Israel on the issue of withdrawal (Damascus radio, 9 December 1993). Implications Although Damascus is probably hoping that the attack will scuttle the DOP, Syrian media's anti-PLO attacks and shrill, hostile rhetoric on Israel will likely subside, though not disappear, if peace negotiations are brought back on track. Moreover, in raising claims that coexistence is impossible, Syrian media took care to rule out coexistence not between Israel and the Arab states but between \"Israelis and Arabs\" --presumably in the occupied territories. By such behavior, Syria has ensured that the door remains open to the eventual resumption of the peace talks. (AUTHOR: BROWN.

The newspaper's two-part investigative report on this subject published on 23 and 24 January included comments from Egyptian health officials and meat industry representatives. According to AL-WAFD, this \"spoiled\" meat is said to frequently exceed international standards fdr fat content and is available at extremely low cost to local importers, and, consequently \"the meat is sold at from LE 7 to LE 10 whereas the import cost is only LE 1.\" Due to the profit margin available from sales to Egypt, European distributors and Egyptian middlemen are reportedly mounting a campaign against the Egyptian Government \"to pressure the Egyptian government into raising the fat content of imported meat from 2O percent to 35 percent; in other words, for every 1000 kgs of meat, the fat content is 350 kgs.\" AL-WAFD continues, \"This pressure by distributors extends even to EC officials, to the point that one official has threatened to halt meat shipments to Egypt.\" In an effort to circumvent government controls, importers reportedly further conceal the fat content of foreign meat imports by selling the meat piecemeal, thereby invalidating import certificates. Egyptian health experts interviewed by AL-WAFD expressed concern about the illnesses that can result from the consumption of such meats, ranging from heart disease to salmonella. They said that the availability of this meat will have a direct impact on the public's health. Of particular concern is the plethora of factories producing inexpensive luncheon meats primarily from frozen imported meat. Health officials pointed not only to the spoilage of this meat but also to the carcinogenic additives used by local companies to retard it. Further compounding this problem is the storage issue: \"Egypt's biggest problem is an inadequate number of refrigeration units to store meat and retard bacterial growth in butcher shops and meat suppliers' facilities.\" Industry experts also maintained that factories and shops must comply with existing standards and specifications; however, they acknowledged that \"the first step is to guarantee the quality of imported meat.\" While Egypt reportedly has procedures in place to guarantee the quality of imports upon arrival, elimination of the \"meat mafia\" requires \"enforcement of (existing) food laT?s.\" AL- ? WAFD has asked the ministers of health and industry to \"confront the demands of the distributors\" and wondered whether \"the health and manufacturing agencies will carry out their role.\" (Cairo AL-WAFD 23, 24 Jan 94) Suez Canal Bridge Planned President of the Suez Canal Agency Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil announced that an agreement had been concluded with Minister of Transportation Sulayman Mitwalli to begin construction of a bridge over the Suez Canal to further development in the Sinai and ease the growing transit traffic in the area.

The new measures reportedly will also apply to small enterprises and to family businesses. The stated purpose of the change is to encourage foreign investors to develop projects in Egypt and create more job opportunities overall (Cairo MENA 8 Feb 94) Minister Comments on Privatization Program, Employment Speaking before the People's Assembly Economic Affairs Committee, Dr. 'Atif 'Ubayd, minister of the public business sector and minister of state for administrative development and environmental affairs, commented on the privatization program and emphasized that \"there will be no rush to sell public sector companies so that workers' rights may be protected.\" Under the current program, \"revenue from the sale will be used to reform the company's financial structures, settle bank loans, and reinvest the remaining funds.\" Reportedly, the sale of public sector companies to foreigners will adhere to certain specifications, intended to stimulate the aquisition of new technology, increase exports, and develop employment opportunities. Dr. 'Ubayd stated: \"We need 700,000 job opportunities annually in order to eliminate unemployment in seven years. This requires investments totalling 14 billion pounds, which the government cannot provide except through privatization.\" He further cited the example of the Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola companies where \"the net worth of the companies was around 27 million pounds, but they were sold for 500 million pounds.\" Dr. 'Ubayd emphasized that the government would not \"rush to sell\" and that that \"there will be no monopolies under the policy of privatization\" and that \"the government will not monopolize any industry of which it retains ownership.\" Dr. 'Ubayd added that \"the public sector's overall capital reached 8.4 billion pounds last year which represents the net worth of companies where the state is a 36 percent shareholder.\" According to this report, 314 of these companies are in the public sector, exclusive of insurance, banking, and military industry companies, whose overall debt is 53 billion pounds.

Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-04MAR94-CHINA-UK-HK","h3":"China-UK-Hong Kong","text":"Beijing Rejects Political Compromise, Plays Down Economic Threats SUMMARY PRC authoritative media have reacted strongly to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco)'s adoption of the first stage of Governor Christopher Patten's democratic reforms and to a Hong Kong government \"White Paper\" on the contents of the aborted 1993 China-British talks, ruling out further negotiations with the British and reaffirming China's previous decision to dismantle any political institutions based on Patten's reforms after 1997. At the same time, in an apparent effort to reassure foreign investors and avoid actions that could jeopardize the European Community's support for Beijing's GATT application, PRC media have portrayed senior Chinese leaders as backing away from recent threats to retaliate against British firms. END SUMMARY Beijing's rejection of further negotiations with Britain over Hong Kong's political future was authoritatively conveyed by a spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on 24 February and reaffirmed by a Foreign Ministry spokesman the same day. The Chinese were reacting to the passage by Legco on 24 February of the first stage of Patten's political reforms and Patten's announcement the same day that he would formally submit the remainder of his reforms to Legco on 9 March and would publish a White Paper on the contents of the 17 rounds of talks with the PRC in 1993 on Hong Kong's political future (Hong Kong Asia television, 24 February). Asserting that Beijing would make good on its previous threats to terminate negotiations and dismantle political institutions established without Chinese consent if Legco adopted Patten's proposals, the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that \"the door of the negotiations has been closed by the British side\" and \"the framework of the political system\" established by Legco \"cannot last beyond June 30, 1997.\" Responsibility for \"the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain\" on this issue, he said, \"rests entirely with the British\" (Xinhua, 24 February). Signaling Beijing's determination to accelerate plans to establish its own institutions to govern Hong Kong after the takeover, Premier Li Peng declared on 25 February during a session with members of the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC)--a group established last summer under the National People's Congress to prepare for the Hong Kong transition--that the \"PWC's burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and greater\" and called upon the members to \"work harder and make even greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability and prosperity\" (Xinhua). Similarly, Lu Ping, director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, warned that the British were \"trying to mislead Hong Kong people\" by \"spreading the view\" that the Hong Kong government based on Patten's reforms \"will not be terminated after 1 July 1997\" and called for \"speeding up the working pace of the PWC\" (Zhongguo Xinwen She, 26 February) Countering the White Paper In an apparent effort to bolster its political support in Hong Kong, the PRC also mounted a media campaign to discredit the British White Paper's version of the 1993 talks, first attacking its credibility and Patten's motives, then issuing its own version of the talks on 28 February (Xinhua). Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of Xinhua's Hong Kong branch, said in a 24 February interview that Britain's \"unilateral move\" to publicize its version of the negotiations was intended to \"deceive Hong Kong people and mislead public opinion\" (Xinhua). On 28 February, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on a lengthy Foreign Ministry version of what he claimed were the \"facts\" concerning the talks, asserted that Patten's decision to publish the White Paper was \"designed\" to \"shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks\" (Xinhua, 28 February). In the text of the document, publicized by Xinhua that day, Beijing reiterated its position that the \"core of the controversy\" was not about \"whether democracy should be promoted\" as claimed by the British but \"whether international commitments should be honored.\" Economic Reprisals Played Down Despite the current political deadlock between the Chinese and British over Hong Kong's political future, Beijing has, at least for now, backed away from its recent threats of economic reprisals against British firms and signaled its interest in longterm British investment. For example, backing away from Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu Yi's 28 January warning that the British Government's \"uncooperative attitude\" on Hong Kong \"is likely to affect Sino- British trade ties\" (Xinhua, 28 January), PRC Vice President Rong Yiren was depicted by Xinhua on 24 February as cautiously optimistic about the prospects for British investment opportunities in China. In a meeting that day with the chairman of the prominent British multinational company John Swire and Sons, Rong reiterated Beijing's contention that Britain's \"uncooperative approach\" was to blame for the \"current difficulties on the Hong Kong issue,\" but he went on to emphasize that both China and the British firm were \"confident\" about the economic prospects of Hong Kong and China and to observe that Swire \"had been enlarging its business\" in the region. Xinhua portrayed the British chairman as \"willing\" for his company to engage in \"long-term investment in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.\" Further suggesting a return to a more conciliatory approach on economic relations, top Chinese officials have assured foreign investors and the Hong Kong business community that its uncompromising attitude on political reforms in Hong Kong will not adversely affect economic ties. For example, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji reaffirmed China's commitment to the territory's capitalist system after the takeover during a 25 February press conference in Tokyo when he \"reiterated\" that China \"will not change the system in Hong Kong after 1997\" (Xinhua, 25 February). He went on to reassure the business community that \"the Chinese Government will continue to protect the interests of foreign- funded firms\" in Hong Kong. Beijing's efforts to play down prospects of retaliation against British firms may be linked in part to China's desire for continued European Community (EC) support for its membership in GATT. PRC media used the recent visit to Beijing of EC Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan to provide an upbeat assessment of EC backing for China's application to GATT. Xinhua of 28 February reported that Brittan, at a joint news conference with MOFTEC minister Wu Yi that day, announced that it would be \"economically beneficial\" for \"China and the whole world\" to have China in GATT. Suggesting Beijing's efforts to avoid any overt threats of economic reprisals, PRC media were not observed to carry Western media accounts that EC Commissioner Brittan--in a response to Wu Yi's assertion during the press conference that the political row with Britain could affect economic ties--warned sharply that retaliation against British firms would be \"completely unacceptable\" to Europe (London Daily Telegraph, 1 March). Implications Beijing's refusal to compromise on Patten's political reforms and determination to proceed with the establishment of a shadow government in preparation for restructuring Hong Kong's legislative institutions after 1997 reflects both Beijing's drive to ensure total political control over Hong Kong after the takeover and the acute sensitivity of China's ageing leaders to perceived threats to China's \"sovereignty,\" including political pressure on senior leader Deng Xiaoping who has staked his reputation on reclaiming Hong Kong from its colonial past. At the same time, China's decision to return to a more conciliatory approach on economic relations likely reflects efforts to avoid jeopardizing EC support for its GATT membership, and may signal a leadership view that, given the failure of economic reprisals to deter Legco from passing democratic reforms and Patten from submitting his remaining proposals for a vote, Hong Kong's stability is best served by maintaining strong ties to the British business community.

Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-07MAR94-CHINA-RUSSIA","h3":"Beijing, Moscow Diverge Over Pace of Improving Ties","text":"SUMMARY Apparently responding to domestic pressures to demonstrate more balance in the country's foreign policy, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev used his late January visit to China to press Beijing to greatly expand and deepen the Sino-Russian relationship and forge a \"constructive partnership\" between the two countries. For its part, Beijing, concerned about the unsettled Russian political situation, appeared reluctant to embrace Kozyrev's initiative, suggesting instead a more modest expansion of bilateral ties. END SUMMARY Visiting China from 26 to 29 January, Kozyrev--the first high- ranking Russian visitor to Beijing since the mid-December elections in Russia--not only reaffirmed Moscow's intention to maintain its relationship with Beijing but also called for significantly expanding those ties and creating what he called a \"constructive partnership\" between the two countries. Introducing this initiative at a press conference on 26 January, Kozyrev said a \"constructive partnership\" between the two countries would mean a \"qualitatively higher-level\" of bilateral ties (ITAR-TASS, 26 January). Expanding on this theme in a speech the following day to China's People's Institute of Diplomacy, the Russian foreign minister portrayed the new relationship as a multifaceted one (ITAR-TASS, 27 January). Beijing and Moscow, he indicated, should cooperate in solving the \"new problems\" in Asia, focusing on the \"danger\" from the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies, the question of access to the resources of the Pacific Ocean, and the problems caused by an \"upswing of religious nationalism\" in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Kozyrev went on to underscore the importance of cooperation in these areas, saying that the failure to make \"joint efforts\" to resolve these problems would result in a \"very explosive\" situation. In addition to cooperation on regional problems, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership would lead to greater Sino-Russian cooperation in the international arena, particularly in the UN Security Council on problems such as peacekeeping operations in Tajikistan and nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. Economic Relations and High-Level Visits Kozyrev also pressed his Chinese hosts to raise the level of economic relations between the two countries, saying, in a press conference on 28 January, that the constructive partnership \"presupposes\" a transition to a \"higher level and more stable\" forms of economic cooperation (ITAR-TASS, 28 January). In particular, he pointed to the need to change the \"form\" of cross- border contacts from \"petty commercial dealings to large joint projects.\" Elaborating on the economic aspect of his constructive partnership, Kozyrev, in remarks aired by Moscow's Mayak radio on 31 January, said that Russia would \"cOunt on\" Chinese support in getting Russia \"included\" in plans for regional economic cooperation. In addition, he noted that Russia was \"very interested\" in participating in modernizing those Chinese industrial enterprises which were originally set up by Moscow and was \"ready\" to participate in major economic development projects like the Three Gorges hydroelectric project. Finally, Kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership proposal demands increasing the number of high-level contacts between Moscow and Beijing. At his 28 January press conference, he claimed that this aspect of his initiative had already been accepted, saying that his visit had \"mapped out a program\" of exchanges which would be capped by a visit to Moscow by PRC President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. Moscow's Positive Assessment Moscow was upbeat in assessing the results of Kozyrev's visit. Commenting on Kozyrev's 27 January meeting with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, for example, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's political adviser, claimed that the two ministers had agreed to continue a \"progressive and constant exchange of views and visits at summit and high-levels\" (ITAR-TASS, 27 January). She noted that Jiang Zemin would visit Moscow in the \"third quarter\" and that his visit would be preceded by trips to Beijing by Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and to Moscow by Foreign Minister Qian. She noted that the two sides had indicated their \"readiness\" to continue negotiating their border problems and had \"decided\" to maintain the \"status quo\" on the border after it had been demarcated. She also claimed that the two foreign ministers had expressed their \"mutual interest\" in further developing \"constructive cooperation\" in the military-technical sphere. A 29 January ITAR-TASS report on the visit was even more positive in assessing the results of the Kozyrev-Qian talks. It said that the foreign ministers had \"confirmed their mutual desire\" for the development of political, trade, economic, and military cooperation and pointed to the need to raise the level of Sino- Russian relations. According to ITAR-TASS on the 31st, Kozyrev was also upbeat in assessing the results of the visit in remarks while made on route to Moscow. He claimed that with the visit China and Russia had established \"new relations characterized by normal cooperation\" and that the relationship now contained \"elements of geostrategic mutual understanding.\" He also portrayed Beijing as receptive to his proposal for a constructive partnership, claiming that Chinese leaders had been \"very balanced and positive in principle\" in their response to his initiative. Cautious Chinese Reaction Reflecting China's longstanding wariness about dealings with Moscow as well as its concern about the unpredictable political situation in Russia, Beijing was considerably more circumspect in its treatment of Kozyrev's visit and his suggestion that the two countries rapidly expand their relationship. Reflecting Beijing's desire for a slower pace of development of bilateral relations, Qian, according to a 27 January Xinhua account of his meeting with Kozyrev that day, underscored the importance of \"maintaining and developing long-term, good neighborly, friendly, mutually beneficial, and cooperative relations\" between the two countries, but did not repeat Kozyrev's optimistic predictions of a rapid expansion of ties. While Qian, in response to Kozyrev's call for \"summit\" meeting between the leaders of the two countries \"this year,\" said that China attaches \"importance\" to maintaining \"dialogue and contacts\" between the leaders of the two countries, he seemed to dismiss the idea, pointedly noting that documents signed during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 1992 visit to China as still being carried out \"step by step.\" Judging by Xinhua accounts of their 28 January meetings with Kozyrev, Li Peng and Jiang Zemin also counselled a more moderate approach to developing bilateral ties (28 January). Li, for example, was reported by Xinhua as telling Kozyrev that the \"correct\" policies agreed to during Yeltsin's 1992 visit should be \"adhered to for a long period.\" Turning to economic matters, he suggested that the two sides need to \"proceed from reality\" and \"explore new ways\" of bilateral cooperation. Jiang similarly seemed to advocate a more cautious approach, telling Kozyrev that bilateral relations are \"developing steadily\" and noting that China's \"firm and unwavering\" policy is to \"maintain and develop long-term and steady good neighborly and friendly\" relations with Russia. Like Qian, Jiang also expressed reservations about Kozyrev's proposal for a summit meeting this year. According to Xinhua, Jiang, in response to Yeltsin's invitation to visit Russia, merely \"expressed the hope\" that the visit \"can be materialized at an appropriate time.\" However, the Xinhua report on Li Peng's meeting with Kozyrev did indicate that Beijing would accept a visit to Beijing by Chernomyrdin, noting that Li \"invited\" the Russian premier to visit China. Further underscoring Beijing's more circumspect approach to the relationship, Chinese media reporting on the visit gave short shrift to Kozyrev's proposal for a constructive partnership, failing to report his 27 January speech to the People's Institute of Diplomacy outlining the initiative. In addition, Xinhua accounts of Kozyrev's meetings with Qian on 27 January and with Jiang Zemin the following day did not indicate that Kozyrev had presented his proposal to them during the talks (27, 28 January). While the 28 January Xinhua report on Kozyrev's meeting with Li said that the Russian foreign minister had stated that in today's \"turbulent world\" the \"constructive partnership\" between the two sides should be \"enhanced and reach new heights,\" it did not indicate that Li made any response to Kozyrev's initiative. Prospects Despite Chinese concerns about the Russian political situation, Beijing and Moscow are likely to continue expanding their relationship. However, Beijing, anxious to avoid any entanglements or fallout from the unsettled political situation in Russia, will remain cautious as it proceeds in developing those ties. Beijing will continue respond positively to Moscow's desire for greater economic cooperation. In addition, the inclusion of Deputy Defense Minister General Boris Gromov as a member of Kozyrev's delegation suggests that military cooperation will remain a key part of the Sino-Russian relationship.
