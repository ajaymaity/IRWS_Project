    "paragraph": "October 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition Metro; Part B; Page 1; Column 2; Metro Desk 931 words A PLACE WHERE SCRATCHED VINYL CAN BE GOLDEN By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER The Rev. Lawrence Bausch says the sources of life's wisdom are often surprising. He said a fountain of insight might be right there in front of you, and you won't even know it. So, for his universal truths, he often heads to El Cajon Boulevard, to what used to be a massage parlor. It's now a record store -- Off the Record. You can buy a Beatles album for $450 or sell one of your Johnny Mathis records for 10 cents. Actually, Johnny might be Mathis non grata at this place. But Bausch isn't. He's a loyal, paying customer, who finds nuggets of revelation tucked away in envelopes that don't -- unfortunately -- take away the scratches that work on the soul like fingernails on a blackboard. But as the man behind the counter points out, with a frizzy-haired shrug, life isn't perfect, is it? Bausch bought one of his favorite albums -- \"Riding With the King,\" by John Hiatt -- at Off the Record, which revels in the offbeat, the forgotten and the never-knew-about, whether it's new, used or on album, tape or compact disc. Off the Record is the sort of store where the Severin Browne and Livingston Taylor sections are likely to be bigger than that of their brothers (Jackson and James). It's by no means the only vintage record store in the county, but, Bausch says, it's one of the best. And it is, as David Ritchie, one of its customers, pointed out this week, \"funky to the max.\" \"It's really one of the best in Southern California,\" said Bausch, the priest at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Ocean Beach. \"I grew up in Los Angeles, but I've lived in San Diego since 1966, and I love music, so I've been to lots of stores like this.\" A few years back, Bausch happily discovered the Hiatt album, parts of which have made their way into Ocean Beach sermons. \"There's this great song on there called 'You May Already Be a Winner,' \" he said. \"This guy keeps getting all this sweepstakes junk mail, like we all get, with the headline, 'You May Already Be a Winner!' He talks to his wife about it, and they laugh about it, and then he realizes that, because of the way they care for each other and the love that they feel, they're winners in a way that money can never duplicate.\" Larry Farkas said that Off the Record, which he co-founded with Richard Horowitz in 1978, has brought them exactly that kind of happiness. He and Horowitz were working for Wherehouse Records, which Farkas said simply refused to stock the marginal, the bizarre or the in-your-face \"punk\" music that they longed to sell. They opened on El Cajon Boulevard 11 years ago, added a \"used\" store next door five years ago and have since invaded Encinitas and Hillcrest, where a new store opens next month. Farkas is proud of the fact that the Irish rock band U2 was on the shelves at Off the Record long before the masses discovered the group. He likes the store's status as an \"underground\" shop, where even the artists themselves occasionally wander in. Band members from Husker Du and singer Henry Rollins are among the faithful who Farkas says often find what they need at Off the Record.  Unusual Singles Found In the singles rack, you can find a category for Paul and Paula, a bubble-gum '60s duo, whose one hit was \"Hey, Paula.\" Incredibly, you can't find that one, but you will find a string of other Paul-and-Paulaisms, such as \"Holiday Hootenanny.\" \"We like being thought of as an alternative place,\" store manager Keith Larson said. \"We're really not for the people who like to listen to Whitney Houston or George Michael. In our new section, we tend to start where Tower (Records) and (the) Wherehouse stop. And, in the used building, well, you might find Frank Sinatra and the Sex Pistols side by side.\" Bausch says he's found records at Off the Record, which caters largely to a San Diego State University crowd, that he could find nowhere else: The early work of country artist Nanci Griffith and Irish classics by the likes of Tannehill Weavers and Ossian. He says he shops at Rockaway Records, Lou's Records in Encinitas and the Blue Meanie in El Cajon. He likes them all but says \"Off\" is No. 1. Farkas, 38, said he has so many record albums that he didn't want to say for publication how many. \"That many?\" someone asked. \"That many,\" he said with a worried look.  Worried About CDs He says the business has been a thrill, but he worries about the impact that compact discs may soon have on discount houses such as his. He carries CDs, but the vast majority of sales are records. \"It's going to be real interesting to see what happens,\" he said. \"It could end up like baseball cards, where it's a market mainly for collectors. Ten-year-old kids are no longer getting record players for Christmas. They're getting CD or tape players. I find that kind of sad. \"I love records. As a kid, I loved watching them spin around on the turntable. I'd like to think there will be this huge market for vinyl, but 78 (r.p.m.) records are worthless and eight-track cassettes are worthless, so will long-playing records be worthless, too. Five years from now, it may be that one part of our store will be new stuff -- CDs -- and the other part will be vinyl meant for collectors. Like me.\" It may be, as Farkas pointed out, that lots of records will cost as much as the Beatles album on the wall with a price tag of $450. It's the original \"The Beatles: Yesterday and Today,\" which bears a rarely seen cover with the Fab Four wearing butchers' outfits. \"It's the genuine article,\" Farkas said, with Bausch noting that that's pretty much what the store is.

Those were among the requests from residents throughout the city that officials will consider when they divide about $50 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said Stephen Rodriguez, an administrator with the city's Community Development Department. Under federal regulations, the funds may be spent on improving housing for low- and moderate-income residents and on a variety of social programs, such as rape hot lines and AIDS projects. Thursday, officials listened to requests from San Fernando Valley residents during a public hearing attended by 30 people in Pacoima. The hearing was one of four mandatory meetings to be held throughout Los Angeles this month under HUD guidelines. \"Housing is the most important problem facing poor people,\" said Ken Mitchell, a Canoga Park businessman seeking funds for a Panorama City investment group to build low-income housing in Pacoima. \"It's becoming more and more apparent that people cannot afford to buy houses and have places to live anymore,\" he said. But Rickords, a spokeswoman for the Valley Mayors' Fund for the Homeless, said her nonprofit group believes building showers for the homeless is equally important. \"Unless the homeless have a place to clean up, there's no way they can find work,\" she said, and showers are important for health reasons. Yvonne E. Mariajimenez, an attorney for San Fernando Legal Services of Pacoima, said her nonprofit group is applying for HUD funds \"to provide free legal services for indigent people who are faced with foreclosures, immigration and welfare problems.\" Rodriguez said city officials will begin reviewing applications in April from individuals and social service agencies for federal funds allocated for fiscal year 1990-91. Those attending the meeting were asked to fill out surveys, copies of which will be given to City Council members to assess community needs, he said. The City Council has the final say over how the funds will be spent. This fiscal year, Los Angeles received about $50 million from HUD, placing the city third in the nation in terms of size of grants after New York and Chicago, Rodriguez said. The federal agency allocates the grants based on population, income levels and age and condition of housing, he said. Los Angeles will actually spend about $70.8 million in HUD funds this fiscal year because of money left over from previous years, Rodriguez said. More than half of the funds, or about $39.6 million, will be used to improve housing through low-interest loan programs and rental subsidies, he said. Separate figures for the San Fernando Valley were not available. The city will spend about $7.1 million on economic development, such as rehabilitating rundown commercial districts, including several strip malls on Van Nuys Boulevard in Van Nuys, Rodriguez said. About $4.4 million will go to developing or improving neighborhood facilities, such as day-care centers and city libraries. Federal funds from HUD helped build the Boys and Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley, where the meeting was held Thursday, Rodriguez said. The city has allocated $8.4 million for public services, such as rape hot lines and drug and anti-gang programs. About $11.3 million of the funds will be used to pay for administering the HUD grants, including monitoring the recipients, Rodriguez said.",

The jury found Laurelwood Convalescent Hospital grossly negligent in protecting patient Andrea Nerpel, 38, who has lived at the nursing home since she suffered major brain damage in an automobile accident when she was 19. Nerpel, who is fed through a tube in her stomach and cannot speak or communicate meaningfully, was raped in 1982. A pregnancy was discovered by her grandmother about three months later, and Nerpel was given an abortion and sterilized. Before jury deliberations began Wednesday, Judge David M. Schacter instructed jurors that they could award damages based only on the consequences of the negligence. They could not award punitive damages against the nursing home because there was no evidence of malice, he said. At the end of the monthlong trial, defense attorney Richard B. Castle argued that there was no evidence that Nerpel suffered from the rape, saying her medical condition was unchanged since then. But jurors said the rape might have been an emotional trauma for Nerpel, although she was unable to express her pain. Videotape shown during the trial indicated that Nerpel is aware of her surroundings and people who come to see her, jurors said. In the videotape, Nerpel smiled when her grandmother entered the room, and her eyes followed the moving camera. \"They were never able to prove that she has no sense of feeling or that her mind is not working,\" said jury foreman Michael D. Williams of Canyon Country. Jurors agreed that Laurelwood was negligent in its duty to protect Nerpel. About six months before she was impregnated, Nerpel was moved from a room in front of a nursing station to one farther down the hall. Jurors felt that she should not have been moved because she was so helpless, Williams said. Nine of the 12 said they believed that $7.5 million was appropriate compensation for her suffering. Several jurors said they believed that Nerpel was raped repeatedly because of the slim chance that one rape would result in a pregnancy. Nerpel's medical expenses are about $4,500 a month, said her attorney, Alan J. Schultz, and the award settlement will be placed in trust to pay them. Nerpel's grandmother is her only living relative, he said, adding that he does not know who pays her medical bills. Castle said Laurelwood's parent company, Western Medical Enterprises, will appeal the award. \"It's obvious that the jury in a state of emotion decided to punish Laurelwood,\" Castle said. \"An emotional issue can defeat justice. The only damages were to compensate Andrea for the harm that she suffered, but there is no evidence of that. Nobody knows if she knows she was raped or not.\"",

By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER Frank Fisher couldn't believe the news, the first good news he had heard in a long time. Two years ago a brush fire destroyed his house in Saugus, forcing Fisher and his wife of 63 years, Mabel, to live in a trailer on the property ever since. Then in August, their landlord cut off their electricity and water in a lease dispute, leaving them without utilities for 55 days. So Thursday morning it was hard for Fisher, 82, to believe that the owners of Apple Homes, a mobile home dealership in Canyon Country, had offered the couple a new $35,000 mobile home free of charge. The mobile home dealers, brothers Robert and Pat Milan, had already found a space for the unit at a mobile home park in Canyon Country and said they would pay the $275 monthly rent. \"We'd like to do something to help you two,\" Robert Milan told the Fishers at his office, saying he had read newspaper accounts of their plight. The couple had been brought there by their attorney, Richard A. Patterson, who on Oct. 2 won a court order forcing the landlord, Bill Jordan, to re-connect the utilities. Fisher didn't understand at first. He thanked the Milan brothers for their interest but said there was no way he could afford to buy a mobile home. Then the news sank in. It was all free. He looked stunned. \"I don't want to be a beggar,\" he protested. Mabel Fisher, 85, possibly embarrassed, just looked away. \"I don't want to impose on anyone,\" Frank Fisher continued. \"All my life I've been able to work. You can't do it for free.\" But Patterson reminded Fisher that the stress of the dispute over the lease had aggravated a heart condition. \"You can't work,\" Patterson said, pleading with him to accept the gift. The Fishers stood quietly, thinking. The house that burned to the ground two years ago was to have been their retirement home. A tough man with a sharp tongue, Frank Fisher built the home himself after a lifetime of unusual jobs, from stunt man and chef to ambulance driver and used-car salesman. He once wrestled bears in a movie. The Fishers obtained a lease to live on the remote Saugus property, along Hasley Canyon Road, 19 years ago. But Jordan maintained that the lease, which expires Dec. 20, 1990, became void when the house was destroyed. He also said the trailer was a hazard because the electricity had been connected illegally. Patterson admitted that Los Angeles County ordinances do not allow a trailer on the property. All he wanted, he said, was time to find a new residence for the Fishers. But Thursday morning, the Fishers repeatedly resisted Patterson's pleas. \"I'm better off in the damned trailer,\" Frank Fisher said. \"All my life I've paid my way.\" \"You've had a lot of bad luck and it's time you had some good luck,\" Pat Milan said. Finally, the Fishers were taken to Sierra Park, a 75-space mobile home park along Soledad Canyon Road. The Milans and another Apple Homes employee, Duke Eriksen, let the couple tour a home, saying it was identical to one already ordered for the Fishers. Finally, Mabel Fisher spoke. \"Beautiful,\" she said. \"My mother lives here,\" Pat Milan said. \"You'll be her neighbor.\" The Milans then led the Fishers to a vacant trailer space shaded by a large oak tree. Their mobile home would go here, the Milans said. It will be ready in about a month. For the first time all day, Mabel Fisher smiled. She and her husband had a new home. \"I've have a lot of surprises in my life, but I ain't never had one like this,\" Frank Fisher said as tears filled his eyes. \"I can't tell you how grateful I am. I don't have any words.\" Photo, Frank Fisher, above right, and wife, Mabel, beside him, in meeting at dealership could not believe offer of mobile home.

He also said the trailer was a hazard because the electricity had been connected illegally. Patterson admitted that Los Angeles County ordinances do not allow a trailer on the property. All he wanted, he said, was time to find a new residence for the Fishers. But Thursday morning, the Fishers repeatedly resisted Patterson's pleas. \"I'm better off in the damned trailer,\" Frank Fisher said. \"All my life I've paid my way.\" \"You've had a lot of bad luck and it's time you had some good luck,\" Pat Milan said. Finally, the Fishers were taken to Sierra Park, a 75-space mobile home park along Soledad Canyon Road. The Milans and another Apple Homes employee, Duke Eriksen, let the couple tour a home, saying it was identical to one already ordered for the Fishers. Finally, Mabel Fisher spoke. \"Beautiful,\" she said. \"My mother lives here,\" Pat Milan said. \"You'll be her neighbor.\" The Milans then led the Fishers to a vacant trailer space shaded by a large oak tree. Their mobile home would go here, the Milans said. It will be ready in about a month. For the first time all day, Mabel Fisher smiled. She and her husband had a new home. \"I've have a lot of surprises in my life, but I ain't never had one like this,\" Frank Fisher said as tears filled his eyes. \"I can't tell you how grateful I am. I don't have any words.\"",

Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber gave Sammie Lavern McGee, 38, the relatively short term because she had no prior criminal record and feels remorse for the killing. Voluntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 11 years. With credit for time she has already served in jail and work performed while in custody, McGee will be eligible for parole in 45 days, Haber said. McGee pleaded guilty May 31 to one count of voluntary manslaughter in the May, 14, 1988, death of her son, Bluefus Davis, 18. In exchange for McGee's guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of murder. Davis, whom police said was a gang member, was found lying in the living room of his mother's apartment in the 14600 block of Parthenia Street. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Witnesses said McGee picked up a steak knife and stabbed Davis once in the chest after he told her he was a gang member and \"nobody messes with me.\" Some friends and family members told police McGee stabbed her son after an argument over his refusal to pay $50 in phone calls, for which his mother had been billed. Other witnesses contended that McGee wanted the money to buy cocaine, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Plafker, prosecutor in the case. Plafker argued for a mid-range prison term of six years. McGee's attorney, Phil Nameth, had asked that McGee be sentenced to probation, saying she had suffered enough while incarcerated.

At the suggestion of RTD Director Nick Patsouras, the board without dissent gave its support to a plan unveiled several months ago by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude. The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is studying Valley route options and also whether the system should be underground in residential areas. The RTD would operate any line built in the Valley. RTD spokesman Jim Smart said that while directors normally steer clear of route decisions, \"this alignment has drawn so much support that the board decided to get on board.\" The Robbins-Braude Metro Rail proposal was offered as an alternative in May to ground-level light rail, which also is being studied by the commission. Because Metro Rail is far costlier than light rail, Robbins and Braude envision extending the line initially only from the Metro Rail station at Chandler and Lankershim boulevards in North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin. Under the plan, which has the support of most homeowner and business groups, passengers bound for the West Valley would transfer to buses at a station near Victory and Balboa boulevards in Encino.

Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Richard G. Kolostian, who sentenced Kenneth Charles Swofford to 28 months in June, reduced the sentence by one year Wednesday, saying it was a hardship on Swofford's family and that he had erred in making the initial sentence so stiff. Swofford's attorney, John Yzurdiaga, had requested the sentence reduction. Swofford, 55, who played a high school principal in the television show \"Fame,\" which aired in syndication until 1987, had pleaded no contest at an earlier hearing to drunk-driving charges stemming from the Dec. 11 accident. Swofford was driving west on Ventura Boulevard when his car swerved into oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into a car driven by George Charous, 37, of Studio City.

At the time of the initial sentencing, Kolostian noted that the actor had no prior history of arrests or convictions, but the judge said he was going to give Swofford a stiff sentence because \"unless a first-time drunk driver is sentenced to jail time, we won't have any effect on drunk drivers.\" Under terms of a plea bargain, Kolostian could have given Swofford a maximum sentence of four years.

A glance down the list of entrees reads something like a Fifth Avenue fashion parade for foods. Those ingredients that may as well have come off the designer shelf are noted here in italics, and are numerous. In the 1990s, at least a few of them presumably will go the way of the mini or the maxi, perhaps to return in a later age. There are, for example, Wisconsin duckling with cepes, and a \"California coq au vin\" of chicken braised in Zinfandel with pancetta, onions and carrots. The sauteed boneless breast of chicken arrives stuffed with goat cheese and basil, the Norwegian salmon mesquite grilled with cilantro beurre blanc. Grilled jumbo shrimp may be naked and unsauced, but they garnish a bed of angel hair pasta dressed with tomato concasse, herbs, lemon juice, shallots and olive oil. In '80s terms, the menu would be incomplete without five spice baked halibut with black and pink peppercorns. It also gets the necessary accents from the morels that garnish the veal chop, and the onion confit that glamorizes the otherwise Plain Jane New York steak.  Two Ageless Classics However, just as a few very proper ladies always wear their hems at mid-calf, the menu concludes with two ageless classics, a rack of lamb roasted with rosemary and garlic, and filet of beef with goose liver pate and truffled brown sauce. The nice thing about this roster of ingredients is that it has greatly expanded our eating options, both by introducing novelties that formerly belonged only to specific ethnic cuisines (pancetta is Italian belly bacon, for example), and by internationalizing others, as in the cilantro beurre blanc, which puts a Mexican accent on a quintessentially French butter sauce. These dishes add up to a fine menu for the Del Mar Bistro Garden, a descriptively named eatery that encompasses a pair of dining rooms and a handsome outdoor terrace. Dinner is possible outside, but because Southern California restaurant patrons generally disdain the great outdoors at night, the garden terrace sees most of its action at lunch; the dining rooms, with their high pitched ceilings and white walls, have a sort of French country look but the casually chic atmosphere typical of the North County coast. Trendiness is the watchword in all departments of the menu, which starts out calmly enough with an appetizer of oysters on the half shell, but plunges immediately into ahi sashimi (thinly sliced raw Hawaiian tuna with Japanese seasonings), gravad lax (Scandinavian cured salmon), a casserole of snails and cured ham and, for the nutritionally nervous, a plate of mesquite grilled vegetables with garlic mayonnaise. Tradition returns briefly on the soup list with the onion soup gratinee, but vanishes again with the lobster and leek bisque en croute. This soup had the potential to be good, but it tasted of commercial lobster soup base, included far too much leek and was canopied by soggy, half-baked commercial puff pastry that would have been happier had it remained in its box. Caesar and spinach salads dominate the greenery patch. But the less assertive Bistro salad is really quite nice, because it stylishly tosses the best greens with fresh herbs, lemon and a mixture of oils.  Blended and Balanced Pizza and pasta also appear, as they virtually must these days, and occasionally in wild guises, such as the moo shu shrimp pizza and the lobster-stuffed ravioli with cream, Port and rosemary. The angel hair pasta with sauteed scallops and a lightly creamy sauce elaborated from decent Chardonnay is calmer and quite tasty, the flavors beautifully blended and balanced. Among the entrees, the grilled veal chop is outstanding. All that really is required here are a thoughtfully cut, well-trimmed piece of meat and a cook who knows how to grill it, both elements usually lacking with restaurant veal chops. The Del Mar Bistro Garden did send out a carefully done chop, however, and the forest-perfumed morel mushrooms, so perfect for the meat, were lavishly apportioned. The plate garnish included a fancy arrangement of crisply cooked tiny yellow squash, waffle-cut carrots and pea pods, as well as a small cake of gratin dauphinoise, or cream-scalloped potatoes. The grilled giant sea scallops also pleased, not only for the lightness of the kitchen's touch (they were barely done, and ever so juicy), but for the brilliant, emerald-colored tarragon puree that gave them such a lift. Color and much additional flavor also came from the topping of grilled red bell pepper bits, which were arranged in decorative crowns atop each of the shellfish. The dessert cart offers mostly catered products and is of limited interest. But guests who plan ahead and order the Belgian chocolate souffle when they give the dinner order will find themselves, at meal's end, dipping up a Sybaritic soup of gooey puffed chocolate and velvety custard sauce. This restaurant's luncheon menu also is quite attractive. Many items repeat from dinner, but the composed salads are served only at lunch and are sometimes stunning. The finest salad is the Del Mar Cobb, which substitutes crab, shrimp and tiny scallops for the traditional turkey and bacon and carefully decorates them with avocado, tomato and a wonderfully generous sprinkling of crumbled blue cheese. The California chicken salad also is handled well, the sliced breast meat tossed with raspberry vinegar and deliciously musty walnut oil for moistening, and with snow peas, lettuces and shredded vegetables for substance.  An Unusual Sandwich None of the sandwiches were sampled, but the list includes an ahi \"burger\" of grilled tuna steak on a bun with marinated roasted peppers and avocado; a sandwich of roast turkey carved from a whole roasted turkey rather than from one of those insidious commercial turkey rolls, and an unusual club sandwich of mesquite grilled chicken breast with pesto mayonnaise, bacon, lettuce and tomato. Among the entrees, the only dish that does not also appear on the dinner list is the crab and spinach omelet. The kitchen included plenty of crab in the fluffy egg mixture (James Beard said that shellfish must be served lavishly or not at all, and it is impossible to disagree), but the flavor overall was quite flat. The simple addition of an herb -- tarragon would be ideal -- would have brought up both the crab and the eggs, and melded them into something far better than this workmanlike but dull omelet.
